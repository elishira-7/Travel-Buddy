# Travel-Buddy
Python project exploring data cleaning, structured datasets, and filtering through this databaase.




Python Data / Database Project
Overview

This project focuses on working with structured datasets using Python. The main aim is to practise data cleaning, organisation, and making small, controlled changes to an existing codebase while ensuring that functionality remains stable.
The project was completed independently as part of ongoing skills development in Python and data handling.



What the Project Does:
  Loads and works with structured datasets
  Cleans and organises data to improve consistency
  Reads and modifies existing Python code to add small features or fix issues
  Tests changes carefully to avoid breaking existing functionality



Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
Git



Project Structure
/data        – input datasets  
/src         – Python scripts  
/analysis    – data processing and testing  



What I Learned:
How to work imperfect datasets
How to read and understand existing code before making changes
The importance of making small, testable changes
Debugging issues caused by data inconsistencies and logic errors



Current Status:
This project was created for learning purposes and is still in progress. Further improvements and refinements may be added over time.
